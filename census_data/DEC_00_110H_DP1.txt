Where the boundary of a congressional district for the 110th
Congress splits a Census 2000 block, the Census Bureau's map
depicts its location correctly, but for data tabulation purposes,
that block is allocated in its entirety to the 110th Congressional
District specified by the state. For a list of 110th Congressional
Districts that split blocks, see
